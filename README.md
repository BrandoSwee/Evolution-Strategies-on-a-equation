# Evolution-Strategies-on-an-equation
The program evolves a solution for this equation with Evolutionary Strategies.\
f(x1, x2) = 21.5 + x1 * sin(4πx1) + x2 * sin(20πx2) \
with constraints: \
-3.0 ≤ x1 ≤ 12.0 and 4.0 ≤ x2 ≤ 6.0 \
By using discrete and intermediary global recombination, it will run for a specified number of populations. Once done it will give an output of results obtained.
